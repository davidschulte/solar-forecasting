Forecasting of German Solar Power Generetaion
This is a project for the course Statistical Tools in Finance and Insurance at Humboldt University of Berlin instructed by Prof. Dr. LÃ³pez Cabrera.
The data is provided by Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.

We fit a model to the daily solar power generation in Germany.

This is the daily solar power generation in Germany in the years 2010 to 2020.

First, the we apply a logit normal transformation to normalize the data.
Distribution before transformation | Distribution after transformation
:---------------------------------:|:-------------------------:

Then, we get rid of the strong seasonality in the data by applying a linear regression with carefully chosen regressors to model the strong seasonality.

Lastly, we fit an ARMA model to the residuals to model the sort-term variability.
